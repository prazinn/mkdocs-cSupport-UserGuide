# Ticket View

The Ticket View provides a comprehensive view of a single support ticket. It displays all relevant details, including the client's information, the problem description, ticket status, and any associated notes or updates. This dashboard allows you to track the ticketâ€™s progress, view its history, and manage communications with the client. You can also update the ticket status, assign it to team members, and schedule field visits.
